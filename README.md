# ThinkRightMan
Simple application to help learning the correct thinking process in Chess. You can define your thinking process steps in the Message.txt file, one line for each step.
The program then asks you to confirm that you have performed such step and moves to the next one. You can also skip all steps and go directly to the next move (i.e. in the opening moves).

You can use the executable in the directory (compiled in win10 under .NET 4.6.1) or compile it yourself.
